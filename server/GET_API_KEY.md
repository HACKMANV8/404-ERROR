# How to Get OpenWeatherMap API Key

## Steps:

1. **Go to OpenWeatherMap website**
   - Visit: https://openweathermap.org/api
   - Click "Sign Up" (top right) or "Sign In" if you already have an account

2. **Create a Free Account**
   - Fill in your email, username, and password
   - Verify your email address

3. **Get Your API Key**
   - After signing in, go to: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
   - You'll see "Create key" or an existing API key
   - **Copy the API key** (it looks like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6`)

4. **Important Notes:**
   - Free tier allows **1,000 calls per day** (more than enough for this project)
   - The API key may take a few minutes to activate after creation
   - Keep your API key private (don't commit it to GitHub!)

## Once you have the API key:
Add it to the `.env` file in the `server` directory.
